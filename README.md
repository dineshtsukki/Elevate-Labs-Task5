## 🧠 Key Features

- Train and visualize a Decision Tree classifier
- Analyze and control overfitting by tuning tree depth
- Train a Random Forest and compare its accuracy with Decision Tree
- Visualize feature importances from the Random Forest
- Evaluate model performance using Cross-Validation

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset Used**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Target Variable**: `target` (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)
